        <h2 class="description">Description</h2>
        <p>
            This hearty beef and vegetable stew that can be made in the 
            slow-cooker is a family favorite. It is also the backbone for 
            an excellent beef soup, if you actually find yourself with 
            leftovers.
        </p>

        <h2 class="ingredients">Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
            <li>2 pounds lean top round, trimmed and cut into 1-inch cubes
            <li>2 large sweet onions, diced</li>
            <li>2 cups large chunks of celery</li>
            <li>4 large carrots, peeled and cut into large rounds</li>
            <li>1 pound crimini mushrooms, sliced</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons minced garlic</li>
            <li>2 cups dry red wine</li>
            <li>4 large tomatoes, chopped</li>
            <li>1 ½ pounds red potatoes (such as Red Bliss), cut into 1-inch chunks</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon dried basil</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon dried thyme</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon dried marjoram</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon dried sage</li>
            <li>1 quart beef stock</li>
            <li>2 cups tomato sauce</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 class="steps">Steps</h2>
        <ol>

            <li>Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook beef in batches in hot oil until browned completely, about 5 minutes per batch. Remove browned beef cubes to a plate lined with paper towels, keeping skillet over heat and retaining the beef drippings.</li>
            <li>Cook and stir onion, celery, and carrots in the retained beef drippings until just softened, 2 to 3 minutes. Stir mushrooms and garlic into the onion mixture.</li>
            <li>Pour red wine into the pan; bring to a boil while scraping the browned bits of food off the bottom of the pan with a wooden spoon. Continue cooking the mixture until the wine evaporates, 7 to 10 minutes. Stir tomatoes into the mixture.</li>
            <li>Return beef to skillet with potatoes, basil, thyme, marjoram, and sage. Pour beef stock and tomato sauce over the mixture. Bring the liquid to a simmer.</li>
            <li>Reduce heat to low and simmer until the beef is very tender and the sauce is thick, 4 to 6 hours.</li>
        </ol>
